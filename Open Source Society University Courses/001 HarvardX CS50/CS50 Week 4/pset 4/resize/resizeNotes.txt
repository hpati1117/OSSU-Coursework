                before, I had the second arg as:
                bf.bfOffBits + ((oldWidth * 3) * i) + newPadding
                
                The goal was for the code to
                take the cursor to the beginning of 
                the line, but it wasn't doing it correctly.
                
                bf.bfOffBits would be the size of the headers,
                which it would skip correctly. Next, it did
                oldWidth * 3, which was the size of the of the
                pixels in the line without the padding. Afterwards,
                I multiplied by 'i' to be on the 'i'th line and
                would lastly add the padding. 
                
                My first part of the error though, 
                was that there's padding in each line,
                thus it can't just be added once. You're also looking
                into the INFILE, not the OUTFILE, so you shouldn't use
                the newPadding for this since it'd be off. Use the 
                oldPadding for the formula and, remember, there's 
                padding in each line, so you'd want it within the
                'line' formula before multiplying by 'i'. 
                
                This would make the new formula:
                bf.bfOffbits + (oldWidth * 3 + oldPadding) + newPadding
                
                This still wasn't correct, it still had 1 more thing
                wrong with it. Remember what I said about newPadding?
                How it's used in the new OUTFILE, but shouldn't be in the
                INFILE? Well, I think you know what should change next!
