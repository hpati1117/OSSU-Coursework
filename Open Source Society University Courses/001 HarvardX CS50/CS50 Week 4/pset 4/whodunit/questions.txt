1.  <stdint.h> is a header file from the C library that contains functions related to ints, 
    really used for creating unsigned ints or differing length ints.
    
2.  The point of using 'uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t' are:
    uint8/16/32_t is used to create unsigned integers of 8-32 bits (1-4 bytes). Unsigned ints
    can hold a large positive value.
    int8/16/32_t is used for the same as above but with regular signed ints, meaning it can also
    hold negative numbers.
    
3.  'BYTE' SIZE: 1 byte/8 bits unsigned
    'DWORD' SIZE: 4 bytes/32 bits unsigned
    'LONG' SIZE: 4 bytes/32 bits signed
    'WORD' SIZE: 2 bytes/16 bits unsigned

4.  The first 2 bytes in a BMP file are the type and size of the file.

5.  The difference between 'bfsize' and bisize' is that 'bisize' is a signed integer that can be 
    positive or negative, whereas 'bfsize' can only be a positive unsigned integer. Also, 
    'bisize' is the size required by the structure and 'bfsize' is the bmp file in bytes.
    
6.  If 'biheight' is negative, it means that the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin in the
    top-left corner as opposed to bottom-right.
    
7.  The field that shows the bmp's color depth is 'bibitcount', which controls the bits per pixel.

8.  'fopen' might return 'NULL' in lines 24-32 of copy.c when the file name given doesn't exist or
    the progrm doesn't have the rights to access the file.
    
9.  'fread' has 1 as its 3rd argument every time because it represents the number of elements
    being passed through it, which is always 1.
    
10. In line 65 of copy.c, the value of padding from...
    (int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
    ...with 'bi.biWidth' as 3 is the same as...
    padding = 4 - (3 * 3 % 4) % 4
    padding = 4 - (9 % 4) % 4
    padding = 4 - 1 % 4
    padding = 4 - 1
    padding = 3
    
11. The function 'fseek' lets you offset things in a file by X spaces. It's used using the 
    arguments (FILE, long int OFFSET, SEEK_SET/CUR/END). The first argument is the file you want
    to work with, the second is the offset as an integer, and the third is where you want to add
    the often (the start of the file [SEEK_SET], the current place in the file [SEEK_CUR], or the
    end of the file [SEEK_END]).

12. 'SEEK_CUR' is the 3rd argument passed into 'fseek' that tells the function where to add an offset,
    in this case, where the pointer currently is.
