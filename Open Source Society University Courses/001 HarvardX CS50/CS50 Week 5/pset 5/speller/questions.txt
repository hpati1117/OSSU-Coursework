0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by breathing in
    very fine ash and sand dust.
    
1.  'getrusage' is a function that gets the usage measures for whatever you call it on.

2.  'getrusage's struct uses 16 variable members.

3.  I believe we call before and after to calculate in order to have multiple instances of it
    and be able to work with a difference instance of it each time.
    
4.  The way that speller.c checks if a word is spelt correctly is:
    - itterate through each word in the entered text
    
    -+ check if the character is alphabetical and, if it is...
    -- add the character to the variable 'word' and increase 'index'
        by one so the next character will go after this character
        
    --+ check if the current index indicates the length of the word
        is larger than 45, and if it is...
    --- consume the remainder of the string and prepare for a new word
    
    -+ else if the character is a digit, consume the rest of the character
       and reset the index
       
    -+ else if the index is greter than 0, it means we found a whole word, so...
    -- add an end character '\0' to the end of the 'word'
    -- update the 'words' counter
    -- check if the world is misspelt by calling the 'misspelled' function 
       passing in the word.
    -- calculate the time it took for the function to run
    
    --+ check if the word was misspelled and, if it was...
    --- print out the word
    
    -- reset the index to 0
    
5.  We use fgetc instead of fscanf because it gets an unsigned character one at a time
    vs having to seperate the array of characters and trying to access each element one
    at a time.

6.  We declare parameters in check, load, and const in order to pass args to them.
